NovelRT
=======

NovelRT is a cross-platform, flexible Visual Novel and 2D game engine. It is aimed at designers and developers alike, however many of the designer tools and features we have on our roadmap have yet to be implemented.

## Getting Started with NovelRT

Currently there are no binary distributions of the engine as of yet, and we are still in our early alpha for almost everything.

If you wish to attempt to build a basic visual novel with the existing C++ API, you must first install the following dependencies:

### Dependencies
- .NET SDK 5.0.100
- CMake 3.13
- Doxygen 1.8.8 (if building docs)
- Freetype 2.8.1
- GLAD 0.1.30
- GLFW 3.2.1
- glm
- gtest/gmock 1.10.0
- libpng 1.6.34
- libsndfile 1.0.28
- Lua 5.3
- OpenAL 1.19.1
- spdlog 1.4.2

**If you are compiling on Linux, please note - we do not support GCC at this time. Please use Clang instead.**

### Build instructions

These instructions are based on the Conan package manager. you can download Conan from [here.](https://conan.io/)

#### Linux
First, you must install the dependencies. Using Ubuntu 20.04 there are extra requirements on top of Conan. With those dependencies, it looks something like this:
```
sudo apt install clang  libgl-dev xorg-dev libx11-xcb-dev libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-render-util0-dev libxcb-xkb-dev \
libxcb-icccm4-dev libxcb-image0-dev libxcb-keysyms1-dev libxcb-randr0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-sync-dev \
libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxcb-xinerama0-dev xkb-data libxcb-dri3-dev libxcb-util-dev python3-pip \
```

Then, install Conan and our configurations should you require them:
```
pip3 install conan
conan config install https://github.com/novelrt/ConanConfig.git
```

If you are building from a command line terminal, clone NovelRT and set up the build folder like so:
```
git clone https://github.com/NovelRT/NovelRT.git
mkdir -p NovelRT/build
cd NovelRT/build
conan install .. --build=missing --build=bison --profile linux-clang10-amd64
```

Then you should be able to configure and build, like so:
```
cmake ..
cmake --build . -j
```

#### Windows (x64 only)
_Prerequisites:_  
- Windows 10 x64  
(32-bit installation _may_ be covered in the future.)
  
Please download [Python 3 (x64) from here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or from the Microsoft Store. Once that is done,
install conan and our configurations should you require them:
```
pip install conan
conan config install https://github.com/novelrt/ConanConfig.git
```

If you are building from a command line terminal, clone NovelRT and set up the build folder like so:
```
git clone https://github.com/NovelRT/NovelRT.git
cd NovelRT
mkdir build
cd build
conan install .. --build=missing --profile windows-vs2019-amd64
```

Then you should be able to configure and build, like so:
```
cmake ..
cmake --build . -j
```

## Example
Examples will be placed here when we have created some. In the meantime, we advise asking us directly on our discord (invite URL above and below).
